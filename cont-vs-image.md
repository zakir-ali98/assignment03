Docker is an open-source software designed to facilitate and simplify
 application development. It is a set of platform-as-a-service
 products that create isolated virtualized environments for building
, deploying, and testing applications.

A Docker image is an immutable (unchangeable) file that contains the
 source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed
 for an application to run.
